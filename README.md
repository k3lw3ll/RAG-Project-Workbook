# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Project Workbook

Welcome to my project repository! 🎉

In this project, I’ve built a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** that runs locally on Windows, leveraging **Weaviate** as a vector database and **Hugging Face** models for document retrieval and natural language processing (NLP).

### 🔍 **Project Overview:**
This RAG system is designed to:
- Store and index meeting transcripts in a vector database.
- Enable fast semantic search through vector embeddings.
- Generate natural language responses to questions based on retrieved documents.

### 📄 **Project Workbook:**
