Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Project Workbook
Welcome to my project repository! 🎉

In this project, I’ve built Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that run locally on Windows, leveraging Weaviate and Elasticsearch as vector databases and Hugging Face models for document retrieval and natural language processing (NLP).

🔍 Project Overview:
This RAG system is designed to:

Store and index meeting transcripts in a vector database.
Enable fast semantic search through vector embeddings.
Generate natural language responses to questions based on retrieved documents.
📝 Available Workbooks:
You now have two options for building your RAG system, depending on your preference for the vector database:

Weaviate - RAG_Local_HF_Weaviate_v2.pdf
Updated for beginners, with a more streamlined guide to running Weaviate for local search.
Elasticsearch - RAG_Local_HF_Elastic_v1.pdf
Introduces Elasticsearch as an alternative vector database with full instructions for setup.
Both workbooks walk you through the process of:

Setting up your development environment
Running a vector database locally (Weaviate or Elasticsearch)
Integrating Hugging Face models for language generation
Building a functional RAG system that can process and retrieve meeting transcripts
🚀 How to Get Started:
Download one of the workbooks listed above.
Follow the step-by-step instructions for your chosen RAG system.
Customize the system to fit your own use case or dataset!
